        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Acne-Prone Skincare: A Product Selection Guide</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For persistent or severe breakouts, please consult a dermatologist.</p>

        <h2>Shopping for Acne-Prone Skin</h2>
        <p>If your skin is prone to breakouts, finding the right products can feel overwhelming. This guide focuses on what to look for when shopping—the ingredients, textures, and product types that are commonly recommended for skin that tends to break out.</p>
        <p>Remember: everyone's skin is different. What works for one person might not work for another, and severe or persistent breakouts should always be discussed with a dermatologist who can provide personalized advice.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients to Look For</h2>
        <p>Certain ingredients are commonly found in products formulated for acne-prone skin:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Salicylic acid:</strong> A beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that can help exfoliate inside pores</li>
          <li><strong>Benzoyl peroxide:</strong> Available in various strengths; commonly used in spot products</li>
          <li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> May help with oil control and is generally well-tolerated</li>
          <li><strong>Retinoids:</strong> Vitamin A derivatives; available in various strengths (some prescription-only)</li>
          <li><strong>Sulfur:</strong> An older ingredient still used in some masks and spot products</li>
          <li><strong>Tea tree oil:</strong> A natural option some people find helpful</li>
          <li><strong>Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs):</strong> Like glycolic acid; can help with surface exfoliation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Look for in Products</h2>
        <p>Beyond specific ingredients, certain product characteristics are often recommended:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Non-comedogenic:</strong> Formulated to not clog pores</li>
          <li><strong>Oil-free:</strong> Especially for moisturizers and sunscreens</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight textures:</strong> Gels, lotions, and water-based formulas</li>
          <li><strong>Fragrance-free:</strong> Can be gentler if your skin is also sensitive</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building a Basic Routine</h2>
        <p>A routine for acne-prone skin doesn't need to be complicated. Here's a simple framework:</p>

        <h3>Morning</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li><strong>Gentle cleanser:</strong> Something that removes excess oil without stripping</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment product (optional):</strong> Like a niacinamide serum</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight moisturizer:</strong> Yes, even oily skin needs hydration</li>
          <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Look for oil-free, non-comedogenic formulas</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Evening</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Cleanser:</strong> To remove sunscreen, makeup, and daily buildup</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment product:</strong> This is often when people use stronger actives like retinoids or BHAs</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> A lightweight formula to maintain hydration</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Introduce new active ingredients one at a time, and don't use too many actives at once—this can lead to irritation, which can actually worsen breakouts.</p>

        <h2>Product Categories to Consider</h2>

        <h3>Cleansers</h3>
        <p>Look for gentle, pH-balanced cleansers. Foaming cleansers can help with oil, but cream or gel cleansers work well too. Some cleansers contain salicylic acid for added exfoliation.</p>

        <h3>Treatment Products</h3>
        <p>This category includes serums, toners, and spot treatments with active ingredients. Start with lower concentrations and use as directed.</p>

        <h3>Moisturizers</h3>
        <p>Lightweight, oil-free, gel-based moisturizers are often recommended. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid provide hydration without heaviness.</p>

        <h3>Sunscreen</h3>
        <p>Daily sunscreen is important, especially when using actives like retinoids or acids that can increase sun sensitivity. Look for non-comedogenic formulas.</p>
