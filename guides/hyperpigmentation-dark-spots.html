        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Hyperpigmentation and Dark Spots: A Product Selection Guide</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Hyperpigmentation</h2>
        <p>Hyperpigmentation is a term for areas of skin that have become darker than surrounding skin due to excess melanin production. It's one of the most common skin concerns, affecting all skin tones. While darker skin is more prone to certain types of hyperpigmentation, everyone can experience it.</p>
        <p>The good news is that hyperpigmentation is generally harmless and often responds well to topical products—though patience and sun protection are essential.</p>

        <h2>Types of Hyperpigmentation</h2>
        <p>Understanding the type helps you choose the right approach:</p>

        <h3>Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)</h3>
        <p>Occurs after skin inflammation or injury—acne, cuts, burns, eczema, or even aggressive treatments. Very common in darker skin tones. The affected area darkens as part of the healing process. If you're dealing with acne that leads to dark spots, see our <a href="/guides/acne-prone-skincare.html" style="color: var(--primary);">acne-prone skincare guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Sun Spots (Solar Lentigines)</h3>
        <p>Also called age spots or liver spots (though unrelated to the liver). Caused by cumulative UV exposure over years. Commonly appear on face, hands, and other sun-exposed areas.</p>

        <h3>Melasma</h3>
        <p>Often triggered by hormonal changes (pregnancy, birth control) combined with sun exposure. Appears as symmetric patches, typically on cheeks, forehead, or upper lip. More challenging to treat and prone to recurring.</p>

        <h3>Freckles (Ephelides)</h3>
        <p>Genetic predisposition activated by sun exposure. More common in fair skin. Darken with sun exposure, fade with sun protection.</p>

        <h2>Key Brightening Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These ingredients have research supporting their use for hyperpigmentation:</p>

        <h3>Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid)</h3>
        <p>An antioxidant that inhibits tyrosinase (an enzyme involved in melanin production) and protects against UV damage. Most effective at concentrations of 10-20%. Can be unstable, so look for stable formulations or derivatives. Learn more in our <a href="/guides/vitamin-c-serums-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">vitamin C guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Niacinamide</h3>
        <p>Works by preventing melanin transfer from melanocytes to skin cells. Also strengthens the skin barrier and reduces inflammation. Generally well-tolerated, including by <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin</a>. See our <a href="/guides/niacinamide-skincare-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">niacinamide guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Alpha Arbutin</h3>
        <p>A gentler alternative to hydroquinone that also inhibits tyrosinase. Derived from bearberry plant. Generally considered safe for long-term use.</p>

        <h3>Azelaic Acid</h3>
        <p>Works on hyperpigmentation while also addressing acne. Available in OTC formulas (around 10%) and prescription strength (15-20%). Good option for those with both pigmentation and breakouts.</p>

        <h3>Kojic Acid</h3>
        <p>Derived from fungi, inhibits tyrosinase. Often combined with other brightening agents. Can be sensitizing for some skin types.</p>

        <h3>Tranexamic Acid</h3>
        <p>Originally used to reduce bleeding, now popular in skincare for melasma and hyperpigmentation. Works by interrupting the melanin pathway. Generally gentle and well-tolerated.</p>

        <h3>Retinoids</h3>
        <p>Increase cell turnover, helping to bring new cells to the surface faster. Support other brightening ingredients. See our <a href="/guides/retinol-beginners-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">retinol guide</a> for information on using retinoids.</p>

        <h3>AHAs (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)</h3>
        <p>Exfoliate the surface layer, speeding up the removal of pigmented cells. Glycolic is strongest; mandelic is gentler and better for darker skin tones prone to PIH.</p>

        <h2>The Essential: Sunscreen</h2>
        <p>Sunscreen is non-negotiable when treating hyperpigmentation. UV exposure triggers melanin production and can undo weeks of progress in a single afternoon. Use SPF 30+ daily, reapply every 2 hours when outdoors, and consider tinted sunscreens that contain iron oxides (which block visible light that can also trigger pigmentation). See our <a href="/guides/sunscreen-buyers-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sunscreen buyer's guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>Building a Routine for Dark Spots</h2>

        <h3>Morning Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gentle cleanser:</strong> Don't strip your skin—irritation can worsen pigmentation</li>
          <li><strong>Vitamin C serum:</strong> Apply to face and areas with dark spots</li>
          <li><strong>Niacinamide product (optional):</strong> Can layer under or use separately</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> Supports skin barrier</li>
          <li><strong>Sunscreen SPF 30+:</strong> The most important step—apply generously</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Evening Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Cleanser:</strong> Remove sunscreen thoroughly</li>
          <li><strong>Exfoliant (2-3x weekly):</strong> AHA toner or serum</li>
          <li><strong>Brightening treatment:</strong> Alpha arbutin, tranexamic acid, or azelaic acid</li>
          <li><strong>Retinol (alternate nights):</strong> Start slowly if new to retinoids</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> Lock in treatments</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Results take 4-12 weeks minimum; deep pigmentation takes longer</li>
          <li><strong>Don't overdo actives:</strong> Too many strong ingredients cause irritation, which can worsen pigmentation</li>
          <li><strong>Protect your skin barrier:</strong> A compromised barrier increases inflammation and PIH risk</li>
          <li><strong>Address the cause:</strong> Treat underlying issues (acne, eczema) while fading spots</li>
          <li><strong>Consider your skin tone:</strong> Darker skin is more sensitive to aggressive treatments</li>
          <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Daily use matters more than occasional intensive treatments</li>
        </ul>
