        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Dark Circles Under Eyes: A Product Selection Guide</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Why Dark Circles Are Complicated</h2>
        <p>Dark circles are one of the most common skincare concerns—and one of the most frustrating to address. That's because "dark circles" can have many different causes, and the right products depend on why you have them in the first place.</p>
        <p>The under-eye area is unique: the skin is thinner, has fewer oil glands, and shows signs of fatigue, dehydration, and aging more readily than other parts of the face. What looks like a simple cosmetic issue may actually involve multiple factors.</p>

        <h2>Common Causes of Dark Circles</h2>
        <p>Understanding the cause can help you choose appropriate products:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Hyperpigmentation around the eyes runs in families, especially in people with deeper skin tones</li>
          <li><strong>Thin skin/visible blood vessels:</strong> The bluish or purple appearance is actually blood vessels showing through thin skin</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of sleep/fatigue:</strong> Causes skin to look paler, making underlying vessels more visible</li>
          <li><strong>Allergies:</strong> Rubbing itchy eyes and inflammation can darken the area over time</li>
          <li><strong>Sun exposure:</strong> UV damage can increase melanin production around the eyes</li>
          <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Skin loses volume and collagen, making hollows more pronounced</li>
          <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Under-hydrated skin looks dull and emphasizes darkness</li>
          <li><strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong> Smoking, alcohol, and poor diet can contribute</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Matching Ingredients to Your Concern</h2>

        <h3>For Pigmentation-Related Darkness</h3>
        <p>If your dark circles are brown or related to hyperpigmentation:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> An antioxidant that may help brighten and even skin tone. Our <a href="/guides/vitamin-c-serums-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">vitamin C guide</a> covers this ingredient in depth</li>
          <li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> Can help with uneven tone and supports skin barrier. See our <a href="/guides/niacinamide-skincare-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">niacinamide guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Arbutin:</strong> A gentle brightening ingredient</li>
          <li><strong>Kojic acid:</strong> Used for pigmentation concerns</li>
          <li><strong>Tranexamic acid:</strong> May help with stubborn discoloration</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Thin Skin/Visible Vessels (Blue or Purple Darkness)</h3>
        <p>If your dark circles have a bluish or purple tone:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Retinol:</strong> May help thicken skin over time with consistent use (use formulas made for the eye area). Learn more in our <a href="/guides/retinol-beginners-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">retinol guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Peptides:</strong> Support collagen and skin structure</li>
          <li><strong>Caffeine:</strong> Temporarily constricts blood vessels, reducing the appearance of darkness</li>
          <li><strong>Vitamin K:</strong> Sometimes included in eye products for this concern</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Puffiness Contributing to Shadows</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Caffeine:</strong> Helps temporarily reduce puffiness</li>
          <li><strong>Green tea extract:</strong> Contains caffeine and antioxidants</li>
          <li><strong>Cold application:</strong> Chilled eye masks or tools can help temporarily</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Dehydration-Related Darkness</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid:</strong> Deeply hydrates without heaviness. See our <a href="/guides/hyaluronic-acid-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">hyaluronic acid guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Glycerin:</strong> A classic hydrating ingredient</li>
          <li><strong>Squalane:</strong> Lightweight moisture</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Product Categories for Dark Circles</h2>

        <h3>Eye Creams</h3>
        <p>Formulated specifically for the delicate eye area. Typically richer and more hydrating than serums. Apply with gentle patting motions—don't rub or pull the skin.</p>

        <h3>Eye Serums</h3>
        <p>Lighter textures with higher concentrations of active ingredients. Can be layered under eye cream for maximum benefit.</p>

        <h3>Eye Masks and Patches</h3>
        <p>Provide a concentrated treatment. Often contain caffeine and hydrating ingredients. The cooling effect can help with puffiness.</p>

        <h3>Color Correctors</h3>
        <p>While not treatment products, color correctors offer immediate coverage: peach tones neutralize blue/purple, while orange tones work for deeper skin with brown darkness.</p>

        <h2>Application Tips</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Use your ring finger—it applies the lightest pressure</li>
          <li>Pat gently; never drag or pull the under-eye skin</li>
          <li>Apply to the orbital bone, not directly on the eyelid</li>
          <li>Let products absorb before applying makeup</li>
          <li>Store caffeine products in the fridge for extra depuffing effect</li>
          <li>Wear sunscreen daily to prevent UV-related pigmentation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Setting Realistic Expectations</h2>
        <p>Eye products can make a noticeable difference, but complete elimination of dark circles is often unrealistic, especially if they're genetic or structural. Consistency is key—most products need 4-8 weeks of regular use before you'll see results. Combining skincare with lifestyle changes (adequate sleep, hydration, allergy management) often yields the best outcomes.</p>
        <p>If you have sensitive skin, be especially careful with eye products—the thin skin around the eyes is more prone to irritation. See our <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin guide</a> for tips on patch testing.</p>
