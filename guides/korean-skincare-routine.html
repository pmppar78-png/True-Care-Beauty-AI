        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Korean Skincare Routine: A Complete Guide to K-Beauty</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>What Is Korean Skincare?</h2>
        <p>Korean skincare (K-beauty) has become globally popular for its innovative products, focus on hydration, and multi-step approach. While the famous "10-step routine" gets a lot of attention, the core philosophy is simpler: prioritize prevention, layer hydration, be gentle with your skin, and customize to your needs.</p>
        <p>K-beauty isn't about using the most steps possible—it's about understanding your skin and giving it what it needs. Many people find that a streamlined K-beauty-inspired routine works better than a complicated one.</p>

        <h2>Core K-Beauty Philosophy</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Prevention over correction:</strong> Focus on maintaining healthy skin rather than fixing problems</li>
          <li><strong>Hydration is foundation:</strong> Well-hydrated skin is healthy, resilient, and ages better</li>
          <li><strong>Gentle is better:</strong> Avoid harsh ingredients that damage the skin barrier</li>
          <li><strong>Layering:</strong> Multiple thin layers absorb better than one heavy layer</li>
          <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Adjust your routine based on what your skin needs today</li>
          <li><strong>Consistency over intensity:</strong> Daily gentle care beats occasional aggressive treatments</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Classic 10-Step Routine</h2>
        <p>The 10-step routine is a framework. You don't need all steps every day—or ever. Think of it as a menu of options:</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Oil Cleanser</h3>
        <p>First step of the double cleanse. Oil dissolves oil-based impurities: sunscreen, makeup, sebum. Massage onto dry skin, add water to emulsify, rinse.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Water-Based Cleanser</h3>
        <p>Second step of double cleanse. Removes remaining residue, sweat, and water-based impurities. Look for gentle, low-pH cleansers that don't strip skin.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Exfoliant</h3>
        <p>Not daily—2-3 times per week maximum. K-beauty favors gentle chemical exfoliants (AHAs, BHAs, PHAs) over harsh physical scrubs. Can also include enzyme cleansers.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Toner</h3>
        <p>Korean toners are different from Western astringent toners. They're hydrating, help balance pH, and prep skin to absorb subsequent products. Apply to damp skin, pat in.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Essence</h3>
        <p>Lightweight, watery product that provides hydration and often contains fermented ingredients. A signature K-beauty step. Pat onto skin after toner.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Serum/Ampoule</h3>
        <p>Concentrated treatments targeting specific concerns. Ampoules are typically more potent than serums. Choose based on your skin needs. See guides for <a href="/guides/vitamin-c-serums-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">vitamin C</a>, <a href="/guides/niacinamide-skincare-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">niacinamide</a>, or <a href="/guides/hyaluronic-acid-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">hyaluronic acid</a>.</p>

        <h3>Step 7: Sheet Mask</h3>
        <p>Not daily—1-3 times per week. Delivers concentrated ingredients while the mask keeps the skin hydrated. 15-20 minutes, then pat in remaining essence.</p>

        <h3>Step 8: Eye Cream</h3>
        <p>Optional but common in K-beauty. The delicate eye area may benefit from targeted hydration. Pat gently with ring finger. See our <a href="/guides/dark-circles-under-eyes.html" style="color: var(--primary);">dark circles guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Step 9: Moisturizer</h3>
        <p>Seals in all previous layers. K-beauty offers various textures: gel creams for oily skin, emulsions for combination, richer creams for dry. Some use separate daytime and nighttime moisturizers.</p>

        <h3>Step 10: Sunscreen (AM)</h3>
        <p>Non-negotiable in K-beauty. Korean sunscreens are famous for lightweight textures, no white cast, and wearing well under makeup. SPF 50+ PA++++ is standard. See our <a href="/guides/sunscreen-buyers-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sunscreen guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>Realistic K-Beauty Routines</h2>

        <h3>Minimal K-Beauty (4 Steps)</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Cleanser (or double cleanse PM)</li>
          <li>Toner or essence</li>
          <li>Moisturizer</li>
          <li>Sunscreen (AM)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Core K-Beauty (6 Steps)</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Oil cleanser (PM) + water cleanser</li>
          <li>Toner</li>
          <li>Essence</li>
          <li>Serum (if using)</li>
          <li>Moisturizer</li>
          <li>Sunscreen (AM)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Popular K-Beauty Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Fermented Ingredients</h3>
        <p>A K-beauty signature. Fermentation breaks down ingredients into smaller molecules for better absorption. Includes galactomyces, saccharomyces, and fermented rice water.</p>

        <h3>Snail Mucin</h3>
        <p>Yes, really. Rich in glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, and glycolic acid. Known for hydration, soothing, and healing properties. Popular in essences and creams.</p>

        <h3>Centella Asiatica (Cica)</h3>
        <p>Calming ingredient for sensitive or irritated skin. Found in products for redness, acne, and barrier repair. See our <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Propolis</h3>
        <p>Bee-derived ingredient with antibacterial and soothing properties. Popular for acne-prone and irritated skin.</p>

        <h3>Rice Water/Rice Bran</h3>
        <p>Traditional ingredient for brightening and softening. Found in cleansers, toners, and moisturizers.</p>

        <h3>Ginseng</h3>
        <p>Antioxidant and anti-aging ingredient. Popular in products for mature skin.</p>

        <h3>Green Tea</h3>
        <p>Antioxidant and soothing. Good for oily and acne-prone skin.</p>

        <h2>The 7 Skin Method</h2>
        <p>A K-beauty technique for intense hydration: apply 7 thin layers of hydrating toner, patting each layer in before applying the next. Works best with watery, hydrating toners (not exfoliating toners). You can adapt to 3-5 layers for everyday use. Particularly helpful for <a href="/guides/dry-vs-dehydrated-skin.html" style="color: var(--primary);">dehydrated skin</a>.</p>

        <h2>K-Beauty for Different Skin Types</h2>

        <h3>Oily Skin</h3>
        <p>Focus on lightweight layers. Gel creams, water-based serums, and mattifying sunscreens. K-beauty offers many excellent options for oily skin. See our <a href="/guides/oily-skin-care-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">oily skin guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
        <p>Layer multiple hydrating steps. Cream-based products, sleeping masks, and facial oils. The 7 skin method can be especially helpful.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive Skin</h3>
        <p>Look for cica-based products, minimal ingredients, and fragrance-free options. Many K-beauty brands have sensitive skin lines. See our <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Acne-Prone Skin</h3>
        <p>Focus on non-comedogenic products, propolis, centella, and gentle BHA treatments. See our <a href="/guides/acne-prone-skincare.html" style="color: var(--primary);">acne-prone skincare guide</a>.</p>
