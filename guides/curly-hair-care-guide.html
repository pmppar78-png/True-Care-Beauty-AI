        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Curly Hair Care Guide: Products, Techniques, and Routines</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Curly Hair</h2>
        <p>Curly hair has its own set of needs that differ significantly from straight hair. The natural oils produced by the scalp have a harder time traveling down the curved hair shaft, making curly hair prone to dryness. Additionally, the structure of curly hair makes it more vulnerable to damage, frizz, and tangling.</p>
        <p>The good news is that with the right products and techniques, curly hair can be healthy, defined, and gorgeous. The key is understanding what your specific curls need.</p>

        <h2>Know Your Curl Type</h2>
        <p>Curl types are classified from 1 (straight) to 4 (coily), with subcategories A, B, and C indicating tightness:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Type 2 (Wavy):</strong> S-shaped waves that lie closer to the head
            <ul>
              <li>2A: Fine, loose waves</li>
              <li>2B: Medium waves with some frizz</li>
              <li>2C: Well-defined waves, prone to frizz</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Type 3 (Curly):</strong> Defined spiral curls
            <ul>
              <li>3A: Loose, bouncy curls</li>
              <li>3B: Springy ringlets</li>
              <li>3C: Tight corkscrews</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Type 4 (Coily):</strong> Tightly coiled patterns
            <ul>
              <li>4A: Defined S-pattern coils</li>
              <li>4B: Z-shaped pattern, less defined</li>
              <li>4C: Tightest coils, minimal definition</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many people have multiple curl types on their head. Focus on understanding what your hair needs rather than fitting a perfect category.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Porosity</h2>
        <p>Porosity describes how easily hair absorbs and retains moisture:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Low porosity:</strong> Cuticles are tightly closed. Products sit on hair rather than absorbing. Use heat to help products penetrate; avoid heavy products that cause buildup.</li>
          <li><strong>Normal porosity:</strong> Cuticles open and close properly. Most products work well.</li>
          <li><strong>High porosity:</strong> Cuticles are always open (often from damage). Absorbs moisture quickly but loses it just as fast. Needs products that seal moisture in.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Test: Put a clean hair strand in water. If it floats = low porosity. If it sinks slowly = normal. If it sinks quickly = high porosity.</p>

        <h2>Essential Product Categories</h2>

        <h3>Shampoo</h3>
        <p>Sulfate-free shampoos are generally recommended for curly hair. Sulfates (like sodium lauryl sulfate) can strip natural oils that curly hair needs. However, a clarifying shampoo with sulfates occasionally can help remove buildup. If you experience buildup on your scalp, see our <a href="/guides/dry-scalp-care" style="color: var(--primary);">dry scalp care guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Conditioner</h3>
        <p>A rich, hydrating conditioner is essential. Many curly-haired people use far more conditioner than shampoo. This is also where you'll do most of your detangling—always with wet, conditioned hair.</p>

        <h3>Leave-In Conditioner</h3>
        <p>Applied after washing, leave-in conditioner provides ongoing moisture and makes styling easier. Can be lightweight (for fine curls) or creamy (for thick, coily hair).</p>

        <h3>Deep Conditioner/Hair Mask</h3>
        <p>A weekly or bi-weekly deep conditioning treatment helps maintain moisture levels and repair damage. Essential for maintaining healthy curls long-term. For damaged curls, also see our <a href="/guides/damaged-hair-repair" style="color: var(--primary);">damaged hair repair guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Styling Products</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gel:</strong> Provides hold and definition; creates a "cast" that's scrunched out for soft curls</li>
          <li><strong>Mousse:</strong> Lighter hold, good for volume</li>
          <li><strong>Curl cream:</strong> Hydrating with light-to-medium hold</li>
          <li><strong>Curl enhancer:</strong> Encourages curl formation</li>
          <li><strong>Oil or serum:</strong> Adds shine, reduces frizz (apply sparingly)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Curly Girl Method (CGM)</h2>
        <p>The Curly Girl Method is a popular approach that avoids:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Sulfates (harsh cleansers)</li>
          <li>Silicones (which require sulfates to remove)</li>
          <li>Heat styling</li>
          <li>Brushing dry hair</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many people follow a modified version that works for their hair. The core principles—gentler cleansing, plenty of moisture, and avoiding heat—benefit most curly hair types even if you don't follow every rule.</p>

        <h2>Building a Routine</h2>

        <h3>Wash Day Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Shampoo:</strong> Focus on the scalp, not the lengths. Let suds run through ends.</li>
          <li><strong>Conditioner:</strong> Apply liberally to mid-lengths and ends. Detangle with fingers or wide-tooth comb while wet and coated with conditioner.</li>
          <li><strong>Rinse (or don't):</strong> Some leave a bit of conditioner in</li>
          <li><strong>Leave-in conditioner:</strong> Apply to soaking wet hair</li>
          <li><strong>Styling product:</strong> Apply gel, mousse, or cream. Use "praying hands" motion to smooth through, then scrunch upward.</li>
          <li><strong>Dry:</strong> Air dry, diffuse on low heat, or use a t-shirt/microfiber towel to scrunch (never rub with a regular towel)</li>
          <li><strong>Scrunch out the crunch:</strong> Once dry, scrunch hair to break any gel cast</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Refresh Routine (Between Washes)</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Spritz with water or a water-based refresher spray</li>
          <li>Add a small amount of leave-in or styling product if needed</li>
          <li>Scrunch and let air dry or diffuse</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Better Curls</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Sleep on silk/satin:</strong> A pillowcase or bonnet reduces friction and frizz</li>
          <li><strong>Pineapple at night:</strong> Gather hair in a loose, high ponytail to preserve curls</li>
          <li><strong>Never brush dry:</strong> Only detangle when wet and conditioned</li>
          <li><strong>Regular trims:</strong> Removes damaged ends and encourages better curl formation</li>
          <li><strong>Deep condition regularly:</strong> Weekly for most; more often for damaged or high-porosity hair</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid heat:</strong> If you must use heat, always use a heat protectant</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Curl Concerns</h2>

        <h3>Frizz</h3>
        <p>Frizz is often a sign of dryness or damage. Solutions: more moisture, less manipulation, sleeping on silk, avoiding heat. See our <a href="/guides/frizzy-hair-solutions" style="color: var(--primary);">frizzy hair solutions guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Limp or Undefined Curls</h3>
        <p>May be from product buildup, lack of protein, or products that are too heavy. Try clarifying, then reassessing. Low-porosity hair often needs lighter products.</p>

        <h3>Dryness</h3>
        <p>More deep conditioning, leave-in conditioner, and products with humectants (glycerin, honey). Seal with oil if high porosity.</p>
