        <h2>Understanding Dry Scalp</h2>
        <p>A dry scalp occurs when the skin on your head doesn't have enough moisture. This can lead to itching, flaking, tightness, and discomfort. While annoying, dry scalp is usually manageable with the right products and habits.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that dry scalp is different from dandruff, though they can look similar. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right treatment.</p>

        <h2>Dry Scalp vs. Dandruff</h2>
        <table style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; border-collapse: collapse;">
          <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <th style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Dry Scalp</th>
            <th style="text-align: left; padding: 8px;">Dandruff</th>

            <td style="padding: 8px;">Small, white, dry flakes</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Larger, yellowish, oily flakes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Scalp feels tight, may be slightly red</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Scalp may be oily between flakes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Often accompanied by dry skin elsewhere</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Not necessarily related to overall skin dryness</td>
          </tr>
          <tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Worse in dry, cold weather</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Can occur year-round</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Needs moisture</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">Needs antifungal ingredients</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>If you have yellowish, oily flakes, you likely have dandruff and should look for products with zinc pyrithione, ketoconazole, or selenium sulfide. This guide focuses on dry scalp specifically.</p>

        <h2>Common Causes of Dry Scalp</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Weather:</strong> Cold, dry winter air pulls moisture from skin</li>
          <li><strong>Over-washing:</strong> Stripping natural oils faster than they replenish</li>
          <li><strong>Harsh shampoos:</strong> Sulfates and other strong cleansers can be drying</li>
          <li><strong>Hot water:</strong> Strips natural oils from the scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Product buildup:</strong> Can prevent natural oils from reaching the scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Not drinking enough water affects skin everywhere</li>
          <li><strong>Age:</strong> Skin produces less oil as we get older</li>
          <li><strong>Skin conditions:</strong> Eczema, psoriasis, or contact dermatitis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Soothing Ingredients for Dry Scalp</h2>

        <h3>Hyaluronic Acid</h3>
        <p>The same hydrating ingredient used in skincare works on the scalp too. Draws moisture to the skin. See our <a href="/guides/hyaluronic-acid-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">hyaluronic acid guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Aloe Vera</h3>
        <p>Classic soothing ingredient that hydrates and calms irritation. Often found in scalp treatments and shampoos.</p>

        <h3>Glycerin</h3>
        <p>A humectant that attracts and holds moisture. Common in hydrating hair products.</p>

        <h3>Natural Oils</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Jojoba oil:</strong> Similar to natural sebum; absorbs well</li>
          <li><strong>Argan oil:</strong> Rich in vitamin E; nourishing without being heavy</li>
          <li><strong>Coconut oil:</strong> Penetrates the hair shaft; can be heavy</li>
          <li><strong>Tea tree oil:</strong> Has antimicrobial properties; can be drying in high concentrations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Oat Extract (Colloidal Oatmeal)</h3>
        <p>Soothes itching and irritation. Often used for sensitive or eczema-prone skin.</p>

        <h3>Salicylic Acid</h3>
        <p>Helps remove buildup and dead skin cells, allowing moisture to reach the scalp. Found in clarifying and exfoliating scalp treatments.</p>

        <h2>Product Categories</h2>

        <h3>Hydrating Shampoos</h3>
        <p>Look for sulfate-free formulas with moisturizing ingredients. Avoid products that leave your scalp feeling "squeaky clean"—that usually means they're too stripping. Many brands for <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin</a> also work well for dry scalp.</p>

        <h3>Scalp Treatments and Serums</h3>
        <p>Leave-on treatments that provide concentrated hydration and relief. Applied directly to the scalp, usually after washing or before bed.</p>

        <h3>Scalp Oils</h3>
        <p>Can be used as pre-wash treatments (apply, massage, leave for 20+ minutes, then shampoo) or sparingly as leave-on treatments. Help restore moisture and dissolve buildup.</p>

        <h3>Scalp Scrubs and Exfoliators</h3>
        <p>Remove buildup and dead skin cells that can prevent moisture from reaching the scalp. Use occasionally (weekly or bi-weekly), not every wash. Choose gentle formulas if your scalp is irritated.</p>

        <h3>Scalp Masks</h3>
        <p>Deep conditioning treatments specifically for the scalp. Leave on for 5-20 minutes, then rinse. Provide intensive moisture and soothing benefits.</p>

        <h2>Building a Dry Scalp Routine</h2>

        <h3>Weekly Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Pre-wash oil treatment (optional):</strong> Apply scalp oil, massage, leave for 20+ minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Gentle shampoo:</strong> Sulfate-free, hydrating formula; focus on scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Conditioner:</strong> Apply to lengths and ends (not scalp, unless product specifies)</li>
          <li><strong>Leave-on scalp treatment:</strong> Apply while hair is damp</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Between Washes</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Apply lightweight scalp serum if itching or tightness occurs</li>
          <li>Avoid scratching—it can damage the skin and worsen the problem</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weekly Treatment</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Scalp mask or intensive treatment</li>
          <li>Gentle exfoliation if there's buildup (but skip if scalp is very irritated)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lifestyle Tips</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Use lukewarm water:</strong> Hot water strips natural oils</li>
          <li><strong>Wash less frequently:</strong> Try every 2-3 days instead of daily</li>
          <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink enough water throughout the day</li>
          <li><strong>Use a humidifier:</strong> Adds moisture to dry indoor air</li>
          <li><strong>Protect from harsh weather:</strong> Hats in cold, dry weather (choose breathable materials)</li>
          <li><strong>Rinse products thoroughly:</strong> Residue can irritate the scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Limit heat styling:</strong> Can dry out the scalp as well as hair</li>
        </ul>
