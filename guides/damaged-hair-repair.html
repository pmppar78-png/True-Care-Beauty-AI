        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Damaged Hair Repair: A Product Selection Guide</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical or professional haircare advice. For severe damage or hair loss concerns, consult a dermatologist or licensed hair professional.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Hair Damage</h2>
        <p>Hair damage happens when the outer protective layer (the cuticle) becomes raised, roughed up, or worn away. This exposes the inner cortex of the hair strand, leading to dryness, breakage, split ends, and frizz. Common causes include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Heat styling:</strong> Blow dryers, flat irons, curling wands</li>
          <li><strong>Chemical processing:</strong> Hair color, bleach, perms, relaxers (see our <a href="/guides/color-safe-haircare.html" style="color: var(--primary);">color-safe haircare guide</a> for preserving color-treated hair)</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental exposure:</strong> Sun, chlorine, salt water, pollution</li>
          <li><strong>Mechanical damage:</strong> Tight hairstyles, rough brushing, cotton pillowcases</li>
          <li><strong>Over-washing:</strong> Especially with harsh shampoos</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The good news: while damaged hair can't truly "heal" (since it's not living tissue), products can significantly improve how it looks and feels, reduce further breakage, and help it stay stronger until healthy new growth comes in.</p>

        <h2>Types of Repair Products</h2>

        <h3>Bond-Building Treatments</h3>
        <p>These products contain ingredients designed to help repair disulfide bonds within the hair shaft. Olaplex pioneered this category, and many brands now offer similar technology. If your hair has been colored or bleached, pair these with a <a href="/guides/color-safe-haircare.html" style="color: var(--primary);">color-safe haircare routine</a> for best results.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Chemically processed hair, bleached hair, hair that's undergone multiple color treatments</p>

        <h3>Protein Treatments</h3>
        <p>Hair is primarily made of a protein called keratin. Protein treatments deposit proteins onto the hair strand to temporarily reinforce its structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Common proteins:</strong> Keratin, silk protein, wheat protein, hydrolyzed collagen</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Hair that feels mushy when wet, has lost elasticity, or breaks easily</p>

        <h3>Deep Conditioning Masks</h3>
        <p>Rich, leave-on treatments that provide intense moisture. These help restore flexibility and softness to dry, brittle hair.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Dry, straw-like hair that needs moisture rather than protein</p>

        <h3>Leave-In Treatments</h3>
        <p>Lightweight products that stay in hair to provide ongoing protection and conditioning between washes.</p>
        <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Daily maintenance and heat protection</p>

        <h2>Ingredients to Look For</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Bis-aminopropyl diglycol dimaleate:</strong> The bond-building ingredient in Olaplex</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrolyzed keratin:</strong> Protein that can temporarily strengthen hair</li>
          <li><strong>Ceramides:</strong> Help smooth and strengthen the hair cuticle</li>
          <li><strong>Argan oil:</strong> Nourishing and helps add shine</li>
          <li><strong>Amino acids:</strong> Building blocks of protein</li>
          <li><strong>Panthenol (vitamin B5):</strong> Helps hair retain moisture</li>
          <li><strong>Shea butter:</strong> Deeply moisturizing</li>
          <li><strong>Coconut oil:</strong> Can help prevent protein loss (works best as a pre-wash treatment)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building a Repair Routine</h2>

        <h3>Weekly Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gentle shampoo:</strong> Look for sulfate-free options to avoid stripping</li>
          <li><strong>Repair conditioner:</strong> Focus on mid-lengths and ends</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly treatment:</strong> Rotate between protein and moisture treatments based on what your hair needs</li>
          <li><strong>Leave-in product:</strong> Light leave-in conditioner or treatment</li>
          <li><strong>Heat protectant:</strong> Always before any heat styling</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Protein-Moisture Balance</h3>
        <p>Hair needs both protein and moisture, and getting the balance right matters:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Too much protein:</strong> Hair feels stiff, brittle, straw-like, snaps easily</li>
          <li><strong>Too much moisture:</strong> Hair feels mushy, limp, overly stretchy, won't hold styles</li>
          <li><strong>Good balance:</strong> Hair feels soft but strong, has elasticity, holds its shape</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your hair feels one way or the other, adjust your product rotation accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Use heat protectant:</strong> Every time, no exceptions</li>
          <li><strong>Lower your heat settings:</strong> You often don't need the highest temperature</li>
          <li><strong>Air dry when possible:</strong> Or use a diffuser on low heat</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep on silk or satin:</strong> Reduces friction compared to cotton</li>
          <li><strong>Get regular trims:</strong> To prevent split ends from traveling up</li>
          <li><strong>Be gentle when wet:</strong> Hair is most vulnerable when saturated</li>
        </ul>
