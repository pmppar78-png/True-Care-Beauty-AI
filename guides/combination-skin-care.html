        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Combination Skin Care: Finding Balance</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Combination Skin</h2>
        <p>Combination skin is exactly what it sounds like: a mix of skin types on different areas of your face. Most commonly, you'll notice an oily T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) paired with normal or dry cheeks. Some people also experience dry patches around the eyes or mouth.</p>
        <p>The challenge with combination skin isn't that it's difficult to care for—it's finding products that address both concerns without making one worse. Too rich a moisturizer can make your T-zone greasy; too mattifying a product can leave your cheeks feeling tight and uncomfortable.</p>

        <h2>Signs You Have Combination Skin</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Shiny T-zone by midday</strong> but normal or tight-feeling cheeks</li>
          <li><strong>Enlarged pores on your nose</strong> but barely visible pores on cheeks</li>
          <li><strong>Breakouts concentrated</strong> in the forehead, nose, or chin area</li>
          <li><strong>Dry or flaky patches</strong> around cheeks, jawline, or near the eyes</li>
          <li><strong>Products work differently</strong> depending on where you apply them</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Product Selection Strategy</h2>
        <p>The good news: you don't necessarily need a complicated multi-product routine. Many people with combination skin do well with thoughtfully chosen products that work for their whole face.</p>

        <h3>Cleansers</h3>
        <p>Look for gentle, balanced cleansers that clean without stripping. Gel cleansers and micellar waters often work well. Avoid anything too foaming (can dry out cheeks) or too creamy (can feel heavy on oily areas).</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gel cleansers:</strong> Clean effectively without over-drying</li>
          <li><strong>Micellar water:</strong> Gentle option, especially for morning cleansing</li>
          <li><strong>Gentle foaming cleansers:</strong> If you prefer foam, choose low-foam formulas</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Moisturizers</h3>
        <p>This is often the trickiest category for combination skin. The key is finding the right texture.</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gel-creams:</strong> Hydrate without feeling heavy—ideal for most combination skin</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight lotions:</strong> Good balance of hydration and absorption</li>
          <li><strong>Oil-free formulas:</strong> Won't add extra shine to oily areas</li>
          <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid-based:</strong> Hydrates all skin types without greasiness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your dry areas need extra help, you can apply a slightly richer product just to those spots at night.</p>

        <h3>Serums and Treatments</h3>
        <p>Niacinamide is often called a "perfect" ingredient for combination skin—it helps regulate oil production while improving skin texture and supporting barrier function. See our <a href="/guides/niacinamide-skincare-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">niacinamide guide</a> for more.</p>
        <p>Hyaluronic acid is another good choice, providing hydration without oil. Check out our <a href="/guides/hyaluronic-acid-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">hyaluronic acid guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Sunscreen</h3>
        <p>Look for lightweight, mattifying sunscreens or gel formulas. Many brands make sunscreens specifically for oily or combination skin that control shine without leaving dry patches uncomfortable. See our <a href="/guides/sunscreen-buyers-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sunscreen buyer's guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Multi-Masking Approach</h2>
        <p>One popular strategy for combination skin is "multi-masking"—using different masks on different areas of your face. For example:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Clay mask on T-zone:</strong> Helps absorb excess oil and minimize pores</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrating mask on cheeks:</strong> Delivers moisture where you need it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This targeted approach lets you address both concerns without compromise.</p>

        <h2>Building Your Routine</h2>

        <h3>Morning</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gentle cleanser</strong> or just water if your skin isn't too oily</li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight serum</strong> (niacinamide or hyaluronic acid)</li>
          <li><strong>Gel-cream moisturizer</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Sunscreen</strong> (mattifying formula)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Evening</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Cleanser</strong> (double cleanse if wearing makeup—see our <a href="/guides/double-cleansing-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">double cleansing guide</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment</strong> (retinol, acids, etc. if using—see our <a href="/guides/retinol-beginners-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">retinol guide</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer</strong> (can use a slightly richer one at night, or apply extra to dry areas)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Over-cleansing oily areas:</strong> Can trigger more oil production</li>
          <li><strong>Skipping moisturizer on oily zones:</strong> All skin needs hydration</li>
          <li><strong>Using too many mattifying products:</strong> Can dehydrate your skin overall</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring seasonal changes:</strong> Adjust your routine as humidity and temperature shift</li>
        </ul>
