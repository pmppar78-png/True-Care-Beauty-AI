        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Sensitive Skin</h2>
        <p>Sensitive skin is a term used to describe skin that reacts more easily to products or environmental factors. You might notice redness, tightness, stinging, or general discomfort when trying new products. While some people are born with naturally reactive skin, others develop sensitivity over time due to over-exfoliation, harsh products, or environmental stress.</p>
        <p>The goal of a sensitive skin routine isn't to "fix" your skin—it's to find products that work with your skin, not against it. Building a routine that keeps your skin comfortable and supported is what matters. If your sensitivity extends beyond facial skincare, you may also want to explore <a href="/guides/sensitive-underarm-deodorants.html" style="color: var(--primary);">gentle deodorant options for sensitive underarms</a>.</p>

        <h2>What to Look For in Products</h2>
        <p>When shopping for sensitive skin products, here are some ingredients and features that are generally considered gentle:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Ceramides:</strong> Help support and repair the skin barrier</li>
          <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid:</strong> A hydrating ingredient that's usually well-tolerated</li>
          <li><strong>Centella asiatica (Cica):</strong> Known for its calming properties</li>
          <li><strong>Aloe vera:</strong> A classic soothing ingredient</li>
          <li><strong>Oat extract (colloidal oatmeal):</strong> Often used in products for reactive skin</li>
          <li><strong>Allantoin:</strong> A gentle ingredient that may help soothe skin</li>
          <li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> Generally well-tolerated and supports skin barrier function</li>
          <li><strong>"Fragrance-free" labeling:</strong> Indicates no added fragrance (see our <a href="/guides/fragrance-free-skincare.html" style="color: var(--primary);">complete guide to fragrance-free skincare</a> for more on this topic)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What You Might Want to Avoid</h2>
        <p>Everyone's skin is different, but some ingredients are more commonly reported to cause reactions in sensitive skin:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Synthetic fragrances:</strong> One of the more common irritation triggers</li>
          <li><strong>Denatured alcohol:</strong> Can be drying and potentially irritating</li>
          <li><strong>Essential oils:</strong> Natural doesn't always mean gentle—some can irritate</li>
          <li><strong>High-concentration acids:</strong> Strong exfoliants may be too much for reactive skin</li>
          <li><strong>Sulfates:</strong> Some find sulfate-free cleansers to be gentler</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Patch testing new products is always a good idea—apply a small amount to your inner arm or behind your ear and wait 24-48 hours before applying to your face.</p>

        <h2>Building Your Basic Routine</h2>
        <p>A sensitive skin routine doesn't need to be complicated. In fact, simpler is often better. Here's a minimal framework:</p>

        <h3>Morning Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gentle cleanser or water rinse:</strong> Some people with sensitive skin skip cleansing in the morning altogether</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrating product:</strong> A gentle serum or essence (optional)</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> Look for barrier-supportive formulas</li>
          <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Mineral sunscreens (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide) are often better tolerated—our <a href="/guides/sunscreen-buyers-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sunscreen buyer's guide</a> explains the differences between mineral and chemical formulas</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Evening Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Gentle cleanser:</strong> Remove sunscreen, makeup, and daily buildup</li>
          <li><strong>Hydrating product:</strong> If you use one</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> Same as morning or a slightly richer formula for nighttime</li>
        </ol>
