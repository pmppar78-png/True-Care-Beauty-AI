        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Body Lotion Guide: Finding the Right Moisturizer for Your Skin</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Why Body Care Matters</h2>
        <p>While facial skincare gets most of the attention, your body needs moisture too. The skin on your body can become dry, rough, and uncomfortable—especially in winter or as you age. Finding the right body moisturizer can make a significant difference in how your skin looks and feels.</p>
        <p>The good news: body care doesn't need to be complicated or expensive. The key is understanding your skin's needs and choosing the right texture and ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Types of Body Moisturizers</h2>

        <h3>Body Lotions</h3>
        <p>The most common type. Light-to-medium weight with more water than oil. Absorb quickly, don't feel greasy. Best for: normal skin, daily use, warmer weather, people who don't like heavy textures.</p>

        <h3>Body Creams</h3>
        <p>Thicker and richer than lotions. More oil content, longer-lasting hydration. Best for: dry skin, colder weather, nighttime use, problem areas.</p>

        <h3>Body Butters</h3>
        <p>The richest option. Very thick, often containing shea butter, cocoa butter, or mango butter. Best for: very dry skin, extremely rough areas (elbows, knees, heels), winter use.</p>

        <h3>Body Oils</h3>
        <p>Pure oils or oil blends. Absorb into damp skin, leave a glow. Best for: those who prefer lightweight but effective moisture, in-shower application, massage.</p>

        <h3>In-Shower Lotions</h3>
        <p>Applied in the shower before toweling off. Convenient but typically not as moisturizing as traditional lotions. Best for: people who skip post-shower moisturizing, quick routines.</p>

        <h2>Key Ingredients for Body Care</h2>

        <h3>For Hydration</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Glycerin:</strong> A classic humectant that draws moisture to skin</li>
          <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid:</strong> Holds up to 1000x its weight in water. See our <a href="/guides/hyaluronic-acid-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">hyaluronic acid guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Aloe vera:</strong> Hydrating and soothing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Barrier Repair</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Ceramides:</strong> Help repair and strengthen the skin barrier</li>
          <li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> Supports barrier function. See our <a href="/guides/niacinamide-skincare-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">niacinamide guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Colloidal oatmeal:</strong> Soothes and protects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Very Dry Skin</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Shea butter:</strong> Rich emollient that softens and protects</li>
          <li><strong>Cocoa butter:</strong> Thick and protective</li>
          <li><strong>Petrolatum:</strong> Creates a barrier to lock in moisture</li>
          <li><strong>Dimethicone:</strong> Silicone that seals in hydration</li>
          <li><strong>Urea:</strong> Softens rough, thick skin (great for heels and elbows)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Sensitive Skin</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Fragrance-free formulas:</strong> Avoid potential irritation. See our <a href="/guides/fragrance-free-skincare.html" style="color: var(--primary);">fragrance-free guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Colloidal oatmeal:</strong> Calms irritated skin</li>
          <li><strong>Aloe vera:</strong> Gentle and soothing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Choosing by Skin Type</h2>

        <h3>Normal Skin</h3>
        <p>Most body lotions work well. Choose based on personal preference for texture and scent. Light lotions for daytime, richer creams if needed in winter.</p>

        <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
        <p>Look for creams or butters with ceramides and emollients. Apply to damp skin right after showering. Consider a heavier product for nighttime and lighter lotion for daytime.</p>

        <h3>Very Dry or Rough Skin</h3>
        <p>Body butters or creams with urea, lactic acid, or salicylic acid help with rough patches. Areas like elbows, knees, and heels often need extra attention.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive Skin</h3>
        <p>Fragrance-free, hypoallergenic formulas. Avoid products with dyes, essential oils, and potential irritants. Brands like Vanicream, CeraVe, and Eucerin have sensitive skin lines. See our <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Oily Skin</h3>
        <p>You still need moisture—just lightweight. Gel-based lotions or light body milks. Apply after showering when skin is damp.</p>

        <h2>Application Tips</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Apply to damp skin:</strong> Right after showering, pat skin mostly dry, then apply lotion. This helps seal in moisture.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't forget problem areas:</strong> Elbows, knees, heels, and shins tend to be driest</li>
          <li><strong>Use enough product:</strong> Don't be stingy—cover all areas thoroughly</li>
          <li><strong>Consider time of day:</strong> Light lotions for daytime (especially under clothes), richer creams at night</li>
          <li><strong>Reapply as needed:</strong> If skin feels tight, reapply even if it's not after a shower</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Beyond Basic Moisturizing</h2>

        <h3>Exfoliating Body Products</h3>
        <p>Body scrubs or lotions with AHAs/BHAs can help with rough texture, ingrown hairs, and "strawberry legs." Use 1-2 times per week, then moisturize.</p>

        <h3>Firming and Toning Lotions</h3>
        <p>Contain ingredients like caffeine, retinol, or peptides. May temporarily improve skin texture and appearance. Results are modest—manage expectations.</p>

        <h3>Self-Tanning Lotions</h3>
        <p>Combine moisturizing with gradual color. Good option if you want a hint of tan without sun exposure.</p>
