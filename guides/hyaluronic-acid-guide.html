        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Hyaluronic Acid: The Ultimate Hydration Guide</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>What Is Hyaluronic Acid?</h2>
        <p>Despite the word "acid," hyaluronic acid isn't an exfoliant—it's a humectant. It's a naturally occurring substance in your skin, joints, and eyes that holds water. In skincare, it's prized for its ability to attract and retain moisture, helping skin look plump, hydrated, and healthy.</p>
        <p>A single gram of hyaluronic acid can hold up to 6 liters of water. When applied topically, it draws moisture to the skin and helps maintain hydration levels. As we age, our natural hyaluronic acid decreases, which contributes to dryness and the appearance of fine lines.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Hyaluronic Acid</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Deep hydration:</strong> Pulls moisture into the skin</li>
          <li><strong>Plumping effect:</strong> Hydrated skin appears fuller, minimizing fine lines</li>
          <li><strong>Suitable for most skin types:</strong> Generally well-tolerated, including <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sensitive skin</a></li>
          <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Doesn't feel heavy or greasy</li>
          <li><strong>Layers well:</strong> Works under other products without pilling</li>
          <li><strong>Non-comedogenic:</strong> Unlikely to clog pores (good for <a href="/guides/oily-skin-care-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">oily skin</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Molecular Weights</h2>
        <p>Hyaluronic acid comes in different molecular weights, which affects how it works:</p>

        <h3>High Molecular Weight (HMW)</h3>
        <p>Larger molecules that sit on the skin's surface. Creates a hydrating film, provides immediate plumping effect, and prevents water loss. Doesn't penetrate deeply.</p>

        <h3>Low Molecular Weight (LMW)</h3>
        <p>Smaller molecules that can penetrate deeper into the skin. Provides hydration at a deeper level but may cause irritation in some people.</p>

        <h3>Multi-Weight Formulas</h3>
        <p>Many products contain multiple molecular weights to provide both surface hydration and deeper penetration. These are often labeled "multi-molecular" or list multiple forms of HA.</p>

        <h3>Sodium Hyaluronate</h3>
        <p>The salt form of hyaluronic acid. Has a smaller molecular size and penetrates more easily. Very common in products—often used interchangeably with "hyaluronic acid" on labels.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Hyaluronic Acid</h2>

        <h3>The Damp Skin Rule</h3>
        <p>Apply hyaluronic acid to damp skin—not dry. Because HA is a humectant, it pulls moisture from wherever it can find it. On damp skin, it pulls water from the surface. On dry skin in a dry environment, it might draw moisture from deeper skin layers, potentially making skin feel drier.</p>

        <h3>When to Apply</h3>
        <p>Both morning and evening work. HA plays well with most other ingredients, making it versatile in any routine.</p>

        <h3>Order in Routine</h3>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Cleanser</li>
          <li>Toner (if using)</li>
          <li><strong>Hyaluronic acid serum</strong> (on damp skin)</li>
          <li>Other serums (vitamin C, niacinamide, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer</strong> (to seal in hydration)</li>
          <li>Sunscreen (AM)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Importance of Sealing</h3>
        <p>Always follow hyaluronic acid with a moisturizer or oil. This creates an occlusive layer that prevents the water HA attracted from evaporating. Without this step, HA is less effective—especially in dry climates.</p>

        <h2>Layering with Other Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Hyaluronic acid is one of the easiest ingredients to layer:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Apply vitamin C first, then HA. See our <a href="/guides/vitamin-c-serums-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">vitamin C guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> Great pairing—both are hydrating and barrier-supportive. See our <a href="/guides/niacinamide-skincare-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">niacinamide guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>Retinol:</strong> HA can help buffer retinol irritation. Apply HA first, then retinol. See our <a href="/guides/retinol-beginners-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">retinol guide</a></li>
          <li><strong>AHAs/BHAs:</strong> Apply acids first, wait, then HA</li>
          <li><strong>Moisturizer:</strong> Always follow HA with moisturizer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Product Types</h2>

        <h3>Serums</h3>
        <p>The most popular format. Concentrated, lightweight, absorbs quickly. Typically 1-2% hyaluronic acid (higher isn't necessarily better).</p>

        <h3>Toners/Essences</h3>
        <p>Lighter than serums. Good for layering or as a hydrating first step. Popular in Korean skincare routines.</p>

        <h3>Moisturizers</h3>
        <p>Many moisturizers include HA. Convenient but often at lower concentrations than dedicated serums.</p>

        <h3>Sheet Masks</h3>
        <p>Provides an intense hydration boost. The mask keeps the product in contact with skin for extended absorption.</p>

        <h2>For Different Skin Types</h2>

        <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
        <p>Use a multi-weight formula and always seal with a rich moisturizer. May benefit from layering multiple HA products. See our <a href="/guides/dry-vs-dehydrated-skin.html" style="color: var(--primary);">dry vs. dehydrated skin guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Oily Skin</h3>
        <p>HA provides hydration without heaviness—perfect for oily skin that still needs moisture. Use lightweight formulas and gel moisturizers to seal.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive Skin</h3>
        <p>Generally well-tolerated. Some very sensitive skin may react to low molecular weight HA; in that case, try high molecular weight only.</p>

        <h3>Aging Skin</h3>
        <p>Excellent for plumping fine lines. Often combined with peptides and other anti-aging ingredients. See our <a href="/guides/anti-aging-skincare-basics.html" style="color: var(--primary);">anti-aging guide</a>.</p>
