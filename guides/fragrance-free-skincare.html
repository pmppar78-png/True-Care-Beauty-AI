        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Fragrance-Free Skincare: A Buyer's Guide</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Why Go Fragrance-Free?</h2>
        <p>Fragrance is one of the more common ingredients associated with skin reactions. While many people enjoy scented products without issue, others find that their skin feels calmer and more comfortable with fragrance-free formulas. This is especially important if you're building a <a href="/guides/sensitive-skin-routine.html" style="color: var(--primary);">routine for sensitive skin</a>. You might consider fragrance-free products if you:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Have skin that tends to react to new products</li>
          <li>Prefer a minimal, no-scent approach to skincare</li>
          <li>Are layering multiple products and want to avoid competing scents</li>
          <li>Simply don't enjoy heavily scented products</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fragrance-Free vs. Unscented: What's the Difference?</h2>
        <p>These terms sound similar but mean different things:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Fragrance-free:</strong> No fragrance ingredients have been added. The product may still have a slight natural scent from its base ingredients.</li>
          <li><strong>Unscented:</strong> The product is designed to smell like nothing—but it may contain masking fragrances to achieve that neutral scent. These masking agents are still fragrance chemicals.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're specifically trying to avoid fragrance ingredients, look for "fragrance-free" rather than "unscented."</p>

        <h2>How to Read Labels</h2>
        <p>Fragrance can appear under several names on ingredient lists:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Fragrance</strong> or <strong>Parfum:</strong> The most common terms</li>
          <li><strong>Perfume:</strong> Less common but sometimes used</li>
          <li><strong>Essential oils:</strong> Lavender, rose, citrus, eucalyptus, etc.—these add scent</li>
          <li><strong>Natural fragrance:</strong> Still a fragrance, just derived from natural sources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that some ingredients have a natural scent even though they're not added for fragrance purposes. For example, certain plant extracts may have a subtle smell. Truly fragrance-free products skip the intentionally scented ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Categories to Consider Going Fragrance-Free</h2>
        <p>If you're transitioning to fragrance-free products, you might prioritize:</p>

        <h3>High Priority (Leave-On Products)</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li><strong>Moisturizers:</strong> These sit on your skin all day or night</li>
          <li><strong>Serums:</strong> Often contain active ingredients and stay on skin</li>
          <li><strong>Sunscreen:</strong> Daily wear means extended contact (see our <a href="/guides/sunscreen-buyers-guide.html" style="color: var(--primary);">sunscreen buyer's guide</a> for fragrance-free options)</li>
          <li><strong>Eye creams:</strong> Delicate eye area can be more reactive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Medium Priority (Rinse-Off Products)</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
          <li><strong>Cleansers:</strong> Contact time is shorter, but still touches your face</li>
          <li><strong>Masks:</strong> Usually on for 10-20 minutes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lower Priority (Brief Contact)</h3>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Toners:</strong> If you use them, some contact time</li>
          <li><strong>Makeup remover:</strong> Usually wiped off quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem;">What's the difference between fragrance-free and unscented?</h3>
          <p>Fragrance-free means no fragrance ingredients have been added to the product. Unscented may still contain fragrance ingredients used to mask the natural scent of other ingredients—so the product smells like nothing, but still has fragrance chemicals. If you're avoiding fragrance ingredients entirely, look for "fragrance-free" specifically.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Why do some people avoid fragrance in skincare?</h3>
          <p>Fragrance is one of the more common causes of contact irritation in skincare. Some people with sensitive or reactive skin find that fragrance-free products are better tolerated. Others simply prefer products without added scent. The same principle applies to body care—if your underarms are reactive, check out our guide to <a href="/guides/sensitive-underarm-deodorants.html" style="color: var(--primary);">deodorants for sensitive skin</a>.</p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Are natural fragrances better than synthetic ones?</h3>
          <p>Not necessarily. Essential oils and natural fragrance ingredients can still cause reactions in some people. Natural doesn't automatically mean gentler—it depends on the individual and the specific ingredients used.</p>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem;">How can I tell if a product has fragrance?</h3>
