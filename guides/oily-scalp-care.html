        <h1 style="font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Oily Scalp Care: Managing Grease Without Over-Drying</h1>

        <p class="hero-disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This guide provides shopping guidance only—not medical, dermatology, diagnosis, or treatment advice. For health concerns, consult a licensed professional.</p>

        <h2>Understanding an Oily Scalp</h2>
        <p>An oily scalp results from sebaceous glands producing excess sebum (the natural oil your scalp makes). Some oil is necessary and healthy—it protects your scalp and adds shine to hair. But too much leaves hair looking greasy, flat, and in need of washing soon after you've just washed it.</p>
        <p>The goal isn't to strip away all oil (that can actually make things worse) but to find a balance that keeps your scalp healthy and hair looking fresh longer.</p>

        <h2>Why Your Scalp Might Be Oily</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Some people simply produce more sebum</li>
          <li><strong>Hormones:</strong> Androgens increase oil production; fluctuations during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy can affect oiliness</li>
          <li><strong>Over-washing with harsh shampoos:</strong> Stripping oils can trigger your scalp to produce even more</li>
          <li><strong>Under-washing:</strong> Oil, product, and dead skin build up</li>
          <li><strong>Heavy products:</strong> Conditioners, oils, and styling products that weigh hair down</li>
          <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> Hot, humid weather can increase oiliness</li>
          <li><strong>Fine hair:</strong> Shows oil more readily than thick or coarse hair</li>
          <li><strong>Touching your hair frequently:</strong> Transfers oil from hands</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Oily Scalp vs. Oily Hair</h2>
        <p>It's possible to have an oily scalp but dry or normal hair—especially if you have longer hair. The roots get greasy while the ends stay dry. This is actually quite common and affects how you should approach products:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Oily scalp + dry ends:</strong> Clarifying shampoo on scalp, hydrating conditioner only on ends</li>
          <li><strong>Oily scalp + oily hair:</strong> Lightweight products throughout, minimal conditioner</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Product Selection for Oily Scalps</h2>

        <h3>Shampoos</h3>
        <p>The right shampoo makes the biggest difference. Look for:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Clarifying shampoos:</strong> Deep clean to remove buildup (use 1-2x weekly, not daily)</li>
          <li><strong>Balancing shampoos:</strong> Designed for daily use, clean without over-stripping</li>
          <li><strong>Volumizing shampoos:</strong> Often lighter formulas that don't weigh hair down</li>
          <li><strong>Tea tree shampoos:</strong> Natural oil-control and antimicrobial properties</li>
          <li><strong>Zinc pyrithione shampoos:</strong> Help with oil and can address dandruff too</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid shampoos labeled "moisturizing," "hydrating," or "for dry hair"—these are often too heavy.</p>

        <h3>Conditioners</h3>
        <p>Don't skip conditioner entirely (your ends need it), but use strategically:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Apply only to mid-lengths and ends:</strong> Never on the scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Choose lightweight formulas:</strong> Avoid heavy, creamy conditioners</li>
          <li><strong>Try a rinse-out spray conditioner:</strong> Lighter than traditional conditioners</li>
          <li><strong>Skip it sometimes:</strong> If your hair doesn't feel dry, you might not need it every wash</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dry Shampoo</h3>
        <p>A game-changer for oily hair. Dry shampoo absorbs excess oil and adds volume between washes. Tips:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Apply to roots only</li>
          <li>Hold can 6-8 inches from head</li>
          <li>Let it sit briefly, then massage in or brush through</li>
          <li>Don't rely on it exclusively—you still need to actually wash</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scalp Treatments</h3>
        <p>For persistent oiliness or scalp issues:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Scalp scrubs:</strong> Exfoliate and remove buildup</li>
          <li><strong>Scalp toners/serums:</strong> Balance oil production</li>
          <li><strong>Apple cider vinegar rinse:</strong> DIY option that can help remove buildup</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Washing Technique</h2>
        <ol style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Wet hair thoroughly:</strong> Hot water opens cuticles but can stimulate oil; use lukewarm</li>
          <li><strong>Focus shampoo on scalp:</strong> Massage with fingertips (not nails) to cleanse scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Let suds run through lengths:</strong> They'll clean hair without needing direct application</li>
          <li><strong>Rinse completely:</strong> Residue leads to buildup</li>
          <li><strong>Condition ends only:</strong> Keep conditioner away from roots and scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Rinse with cool water:</strong> Helps close cuticle for shinier hair</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Lifestyle Tips for Less Oily Hair</h2>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Don't touch your hair:</strong> Your hands transfer oil</li>
          <li><strong>Keep brushes clean:</strong> Dirty brushes redistribute oil</li>
          <li><strong>Change pillowcases regularly:</strong> Oil accumulates on them</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid heavy styling products:</strong> Especially near the scalp</li>
          <li><strong>Consider your diet:</strong> Some people find greasy foods affect scalp oiliness</li>
          <li><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Stress can increase oil production</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Often to Wash</h2>
        <p>There's no universal answer. Some people with oily scalps need to wash daily; others find every other day works. The "don't wash your hair too often" advice doesn't apply to everyone—if your scalp is truly oily, forcing yourself to go days without washing can lead to:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
          <li>Buildup that's hard to remove</li>
          <li>Scalp irritation</li>
          <li>Potentially more oil production when you do wash</li>
          <li>Just feeling uncomfortable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Find a frequency that keeps your scalp healthy and your hair looking good. If you want to extend time between washes, do it gradually and use dry shampoo to help.</p>
