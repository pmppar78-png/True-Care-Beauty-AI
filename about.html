        <h1>About TrueCare Beauty AI</h1>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          TrueCare Beauty AI is a curated shopping guide and AI-powered concierge that helps you discover beauty, skincare, haircare, and personal care products from trusted retailers. Based in <strong>Boston, MA</strong>, we're dedicated to making beauty shopping smarter, simpler, and more enjoyable.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We believe everyone deserves access to helpful, honest shopping guidance without the pressure or confusion. Our mission is to help you navigate the vast world of beauty products with confidence, connecting you with trusted retailers and genuine value.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          We compare products and deals from leading beauty stores, hunting for discounts, gift sets, and value-per-ounce standouts rather than just the loudest ads. Our AI concierge helps you filter by price range, finish, routine complexity, and preferences, making it easier to find products that fit your budget and lifestyle.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Curated Retailer Selection:</strong> We spotlight familiar stores and well-known online shops so you can check shades, ingredients, and reviews directly with retailers you trust.</li>
          <li><strong>AI Shopping Assistant:</strong> Our AI concierge speaks plain English and helps you narrow options, compare products, and discover deals tailored to your needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Value-Focused Guidance:</strong> We highlight genuine deals, bundles, and value sets that stretch your beauty budget further.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
        <p>
          TrueCare Beauty AI provides <strong>shopping guidance only</strong>. We do not provide medical, dermatological, diagnostic, or treatment advice. For questions about sensitivities, allergies, skin conditions, or health concerns, please consult a licensed dermatologist, esthetician, or healthcare professional.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Trust Us</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in transparency and honesty. We never use fear-based marketing or make exaggerated claims. Our recommendations come from curating trusted retailers, not from making health promises. We clearly disclose when suggestions may include sponsored partners, and this does not affect the guidance we provide.
        </p>
