          By accessing or using TrueCare Beauty AI ("we," "our," or "the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our website or services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>

          TrueCare Beauty AI is an online shopping guide and AI-powered concierge that provides curated information about beauty, skincare, haircare, and personal care products from third-party retailers. We help users discover products and deals but do not sell products directly.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Shopping Guidance Only</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> TrueCare Beauty AI provides shopping and product-finding assistance only. We do NOT provide:

          <li>Helps compare products and find deals</li>
          <li>Offers suggestions based on stated preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The AI does not have access to personal information unless voluntarily shared during conversation, and conversations are not stored or associated with personal identifiers.
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
